This page is best viewed on a bigger screen. I recreated (to the best of my ability), the search results of The Odin Project.

The work was very tedious and pain-staking, however, it was good practice none-the-less.

I have to admit that I underestimated how difficult this actually was but I think I completed a good (non-responsive) search results page.
